This code is also available as MATLAB code.
get it here:             https://github.com/guynir42/radon.git
and utilities package:   https://github.com/guynir42/util.git

This Python code
1) does not require any additional packages (e.g., +util in MATLAB). A few utilities were collected into util.py inside this module.
2) has no GUI support or plotting tools (I don't know how to do that here)
3) doesn't have tools to strip Radon images and rebuild them later (save memory for writing streaks to disk)
4) is slower by a factor ~3, since the FRT is done in Python, not in C++ subroutine (in MATLAB there's a mex file that does the core FRT operations).
5) frt() function returns only one value, either an numpy array with the Radon transform or a list of partial Radon transforms. It does not return the finder it was given (you have to keep a reference to it, cannot construct it in the call to frt()).
6) the simulator cannot produce multiple streaks at once (can be added later).
